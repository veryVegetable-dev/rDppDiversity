Description: Given item set, item representation vector, and item ratings, find a subset providing a better relevance-diversity trade-off. It's based on the idea introduced by Laming Chen, Guoxin Zhang, and Hanning Zhou(2017) in [1]Improving the Diversity of Top-N Recommendation via Determinantal Point Process and [2]Fast Greedy MAP Inference for Determinantal Point Process to Improve Recommendation Diversity.
